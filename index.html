        It's one of the leading technological hubs of the world and has very innovative people and companies.
        Tokyo, Japan’s busy capital, mixes the ultramodern and the traditional, 
        from neon-lit skyscrapers to historic temples. The opulent Meiji Shinto Shrine
        is known for its towering gate and surrounding woods. The Imperial Palace sits
        amid large public gardens. The city's many museums offer exhibits ranging from 
        classical art (in the Tokyo National Museum) to a reconstructed kabuki theater 
        (in the Edo-Tokyo Museum). Tokyo Metropolis (東京都 Tōkyō-to), one of the 47 prefectures 
        of Japan, has served as the Japanese capital since 1869. As of 2018, the Greater Tokyo Area
        ranked as the most populous metropolitan area in the world. The urban area houses the seat
        of the Emperor of Japan, of the Japanese government and of the National Diet. Tokyo forms
        part of the Kantō region on the southeastern side of Japan's main island, Honshu, and includes
        the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Tokyo was formerly named Edo when Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu
        made the city his headquarters in 1603. It became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat
        to the city from Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis formed 
        in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and the city of Tokyo
        (東京市 Tōkyō-shi). Tokyo is often referred to as a city but is officially known and governed 
        as a "metropolitan prefecture", which differs from and combines elements of a city and a prefecture, 
        a characteristic unique to Tokyo.</div>

<h1>Historical places in Cape Town</h1>

        <h2>Church Square, Spin Street</h2>
<div class="ChurchSquare">
<div class="n5">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Church_Square_Cape_Town_-_Side_view_of_Jan_Hendrik_Hofmeyr_Statue_and_rememberance_of_people_died.JPG" height="100" width="150">
</div>
        <p> On the square is Groote Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church), which has stood here since 1704. The site was originally an 
        abandoned garden plot at the bottom end of the Company Gardens. Back in those days Spin Street was referred to as Plein 
        Straat, or even Kleine Plein Straat. The interesting aspects to Church Square are the invisible bits of history. For 
        instance, the square once functioned as a slave market connected to the Slave Lodge (built in 1679 and thus a contemporary of Groote Kerk), which lies just west of the square and is a very important part of the Cape's history.
        Between 1730 and 1753 Church Square became a meeting place for local dogs. They became such a menace for church goers 
        that the city employed a dog-whipper to stop them harassing those attending church (historians believe the dog menace was 
        directly related to the small pox epidemics of 1713 and 1750 when, at the church graveyard, bodies piled up at a rather 
        alarming rate).
        The graveyard was thought to extend towards Longmarket Street.
        A spinning factory used to lie on Church Square's eastern boundary, and a slave tree once stood in the square,
        a place for slaves to wait whilst their owners went to church. The tree was removed in 1916 but the space remains
        commemorated.

        <p> The Parliament of South Africa is South Africa's legislature and under the country's current Constitution is composed 
        of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces. It has undergone 28 transformations as a result of the 
        country's tumultuous history. From 1910 to 1994, it was elected mainly by South Africa's white minority, before the 
        first elections with universal suffrage were held in 1994. Parliament sits in Cape Town, even though the seat of
        government is in Pretoria. This dates back to the foundation of the Union, when there was disagreement among the
        four provinces as to which city would be the national capital. As a compromise, Cape Town was designated the
        legislative capital, Bloemfontein the judicial capital, and Pretoria the administrative capital. 
        The African National Congress (ANC) government has proposed moving Parliament to Pretoria, arguing that the 
        present arrangement is cumbersome as ministers, civil servants and diplomats must move back and forth when
        Parliament is in session. </p>

        <p>The Bo-Kaap is one of Cape Town’s most distinct neighbourhoods and there’s so much to see, taste and explore.
        Here’s our guide to what you can’t miss while in the Bo-Kaap. Situated at the foot of Signal Hill, on the fringe of 
        the city centre, and formerly known as the Malay Quarter, the Bo-Kaap’s origins date back to the 1760s when numerous 
        “huurhuisjes” (rental houses) were built and leased to slaves. These people were known as Cape Malays, and were brought
        from Malaysia, Indonesia and the rest of Africa to work in the Cape. The oldest building in the Bo-Kaap is in Wale 
        Street and currently houses the Bo-Kaap Museum. This is the best place to discover the real history of the area and to 
        get a glimpse into the life of a typical Malay family.
        The first established Muslim mosque in South Africa, the Auwal Mosque, can also be found in the Bo-Kaap.
        A five-minute walk from the city centre and De Waterkant and a 20-minute walk to the V&A Waterfront, the Bo-Kaap 
        is best accessed by foot along Wale Street. Explore the Islamic “kramats” (shrines), mosques and food and craft 
        markets, and discover the delicious Cape Malay cooking style.</p>
